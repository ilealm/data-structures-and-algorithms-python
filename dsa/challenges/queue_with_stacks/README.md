### Challenge 11

**File:** challenges/stacks_and_queue/stacks_and_queue.py

**Assets**

* assets/queue_with_stacks.jpg

**GitHub** Pull# 10

**GitHub Branch:** queue-with-stacks

[Pull on GitHub](https://github.com/ilealm/data-structures-and-algorithms-python/pull/10)


## Approach & Efficiency
Big 0:
Tine: 0(n) => Because we traverse all the nodes in the list.
Space: 0(n) => Because we are creating copy of the data structure

## Test
#### Source :

test/test_queue_with_stacks.py

**Notes:**

Probably need to execute this line on terminal, because I'm importing from a sibbling package
```
export PYTHONPATH=~/codefellows/401/data-structures-and-algorithms-python/
```
