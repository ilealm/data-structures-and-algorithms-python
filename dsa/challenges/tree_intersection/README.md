# Tree intersection

Write a function called tree_intersection that takes two binary tree parameters.

## Challenge
### Challenge 32

**File:** challenges/tree_intersection/tree_intersection.py

**Assets**

* assets/tree_intersection.jpg

**GitHub** Pull# 23

**GitHub Branch:** tree_intersection

[Pull on GitHub](https://github.com/ilealm/data-structures-and-algorithms-python/pull/23)


## Approach & Efficiency
Big 0:
Time: 0(n) => Because we are traversing all the nodes in both trees.
Space: 0(n) => Because we are creating new data structures, which size can vary.
