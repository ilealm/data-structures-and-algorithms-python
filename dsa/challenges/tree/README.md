# Binary Treee and Binary Search Tree

Create a BinaryTree class with pre-order, in-order and post-order methods, and create a BinarySearchTree class with add and contains methods.

## Challenge
### Challenge 15

* assets/trees_2.jpg

**GitHub** Pull# 13

**GitHub Branch:** tree

[Pull on GitHub](https://github.com/ilealm/data-structures-and-algorithms-python/pull/13)


## Approach & Efficiency
Big 0:
### preOrder
Tine: 0(n) => Because we are traverse all the nodes in the tree.
Space: 0(1) => Because we are not creating copy of the data structure.

### inOrder
Tine: 0(n) => Because we are traverse all the nodes in the tree.
Space: 0(1) => Because we are not creating copy of the data structure.

### postOrder
Tine: 0(n) => Because we are traverse all the nodes in the tree.
Space: 0(1) => Because we are not creating copy of the data structure.

### contains
Tine: 0(logN) => Because we are traverse the half ot the tree in the search.
Space: 0(1) => Because we are not creating copy of the data structure.

### add
Tine: 0(logN) => Because we are traverse the half ot the tree in the search to find rthe right spot.
Space: 0(1) => Because we are not creating one new node.

## Approach & Efficiency
Big 0:

### breadthFirst
**Time: 0(n)** => Because we are traverse all the nodes in the tree.

**Space: 0(1)** => Because we are not creating copy of the data structure.

# Find Maximum Value

Create a method find_maximum_value on Binary Tree that returns the maximum value of the tree's nodes.

## Challenge 18

- **File:** challenges/tree/tree.py

- **Class, function or method:**

    - FindMaximumValue

### Assets

- [Pull on GitHub](https://github.com/ilealm/data-structures-and-algorithms-python/pull/17)


## Approach & Efficiency
Big 0:
### FindMaximunValue

**Time: 0(n)** => Because we are traverse all the nodes in the tree.

**Space: 0(1)** => Because we are not creating copy of the data structure.
