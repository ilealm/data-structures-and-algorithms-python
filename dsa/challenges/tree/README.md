# Binary Treee and Binary Search Tree

Create a BinaryTree class with pre-order, in-order and post-order methods, and create a BinarySearchTree class with add and contains methods.

## Challenge

**GitHub** Pull# 13

**GitHub Branch:** tree

[Pull on GitHub](https://github.com/ilealm/data-structures-and-algorithms-python/pull/13)


## Approach & Efficiency
Big 0:
### preOrder
Tine: 0(n) => Because we are traverse all the nodes in the tree.
Space: 0(1) => Because we are not creating copy of the data structure.

### inOrder
Tine: 0(n) => Because we are traverse all the nodes in the tree.
Space: 0(1) => Because we are not creating copy of the data structure.

### postOrder
Tine: 0(n) => Because we are traverse all the nodes in the tree.
Space: 0(1) => Because we are not creating copy of the data structure.

### contains
Tine: 0(logN) => Because we are traverse the half ot the tree in the search.
Space: 0(1) => Because we are not creating copy of the data structure.

### add
Tine: 0(logN) => Because we are traverse the half ot the tree in the search to find rthe right spot.
Space: 0(1) => Because we are not creating one new node.
