## Approach & Efficiency
For the insertion method, this code have Big O(1) because is inserting at the begining of the list, not moving or traversing existing nodes.

For displaying all the nodes, have Big O(n), because can be conpromises depenging the longitude of the list.

For searching a value, the Big O(n), because the searched element can be the last on the list, ot not exist. As an inprovement, once the element if
founded on the list, it stop traversing.

## Solution
In this case, the problem was very similar to the one we saw on class
