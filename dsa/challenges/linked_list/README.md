# Linked List
This challenge was a excercise over Linklist.

## Challenge
### Challenge 05

GitHub Pull# 4

## Approach & Efficiency
For the insertion method, this code have Big O(1) because is inserting at the begining of the list, not moving or traversing existing nodes.

For displaying all the nodes, have Big O(n), because can be conpromises depenging the longitude of the list.

For searching a value, the Big O(n), because the searched element can be the last on the list, ot not exist. As an inprovement, once the element if
founded on the list, it stop traversing.

## Solution

## Approach & Efficiency
For append method, this code have Big O(n) becausein worse case scenario, we have to traver all existing nodes.

For insert_before method, this code have Big O(n) becausein worse case scenario, we have to traver all existing nodes.

For insert_after method, this code have Big O(n) becausein worse case scenario, we have to traver all existing nodes.
