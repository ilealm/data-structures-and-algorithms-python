## Approach & Efficiency
I tried to implement the solution with approach 1, using recursive, but I couldn't.

Then I changed to a regular function using while to search on the array and It works. I believe that is efficient because first I so a few checks before going inside the while, and when I'm inside the while, I'm not creating new arrays, just moving my indexes to search.

## Tests
My function test are in:

/test/test_array_binary_search.py

## Solution
I implemented approch #2
