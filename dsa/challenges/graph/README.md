# Graph
Implement your own Graph. The graph should be represented as an adjacency list, and should include the following methods:
- AddNode
- AddEdge
- GetNodes
- GetNeighbors
- Size

## Challenge
### Challenge 35

challenges/graph/graph.py
GitHub Pull# 35

[Pull on GitHub](https://github.com/ilealm/data-structures-and-algorithms-python/pull/35)


## Approach & Efficiency
Big 0:
Time: 0(1) => Because we are implementing linked lists.
Space: 0(1) => Because we are not creating new data structure

## Test
Source : test/test_graph.py

# Graph Breadht First
Implement a Breadht First traversal on a graph.

## Challenge
### Challenge 36

challenges/graph/graph.py
GitHub Pull# 27

[Pull on GitHub](https://github.com/ilealm/data-structures-and-algorithms-python/pull/27)


## Approach & Efficiency
## Big 0:
**Time:** 0(n) => Because we need to traverse all the vertex.

**Space:** 0(n) => Because we are creating new data structure.

## Test
Source : test/test_graph.py

## Solution
Solution for lab 36
