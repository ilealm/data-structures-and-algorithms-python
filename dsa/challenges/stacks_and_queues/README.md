# Stacks and  Queues
Create the methods push, pop, peek and is_empty for a single linkedlist using Stack approach.

Create the methods enqueue, dequeue, peek and is_empty for a single linkedlist using Queue approach.

All methods should have Big O(1)

## Challenge
### Challenge 10

**File:** challenges/stacks_and_queue/stacks_and_queue.py

**Assets**

* assets/stack.jpg
* assets/queue.jpg

**GitHub** Pull# 10

**GitHub Branch:** stack_and_queue

[Pull on GitHub](https://github.com/ilealm/data-structures-and-algorithms-python/pull/10)


## Approach & Efficiency
Big 0:
Tine: 0(1) => Because we don't traverse all the nodes in the list.
Space: 0(1) => Because we are not creating new data structure

## Test
#### Source :

test/test_stacks_and_queues.py

**Notes:**

I have some test with exit, they are reviewing that the raise Exception funcionality occurs, but also generate error on pytest. Not sure how to test this.
