## Approach & Efficiency
I had 3 different approach on this challange, but decided to go for the less buldin functionality.
For big O, the time will be compromise depending on the long on the original array, and the fact I'm creating a new array and looping through.
Depending on the real scenario of the use case, this can be a problem, or not.

## Solution
I implemented approch #3
